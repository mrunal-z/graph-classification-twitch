This project was for the course CS286: Machine Learning on Graphs.

# Graph Classification of Twitch User Networks
The main objective of this project was to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a Twitch user plays a single game or multiple games based on their ego-net.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the ego-nets of Twitch users who participated in the partnership program in April 2018, and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.chrsmrrs.com/graphkerneldatasets/twitch_egos.zip). More information on this dataset is available [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_ego_nets.html). 

This dataset needed to be preprocessed into a .csv file which can be found in **Processed Dataset/balanced_dataset_2000_graphs.csv** file.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches used
